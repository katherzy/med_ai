medical chatbot wip.

Up to 60% of ER visits are less-urgent or non-urgent (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9880025/). Optimizing care pathways helps ensure emergency departments are reserved for true emergencies. The goal is to ensure every patient receives the right care, in the right place, at the right time. This chatbot aims to guide users to either the ER or urgent care or a doctor's visit dependent on user responses. 

--> Optimized care pathways for the community and potential cost savings for the individual.

Future improvements:
- Incorporate what medical diagnostics are available at nearby urgent care and ER rooms i.e. what's the closest, most cost efficient, most optimized care route? -- Personal anecdote: had concussion symptoms, went to urgent care, directed to ER for a CT scan.
